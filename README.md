# Codenames
A codenames bot playing the part of a spymaster.

To use this program, you need to do the following:

1. Download the c++ source.

2. Compile it using (for instance) g++ -std=c++11 -Ofast codenames.cpp

3. Download a word2vec-like model and save it to "data.txt". You can download such a model from http://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/glove/. I have used the file glove.6B.zip (300-dimensional vectors), but you would probably get better results with a larger model.

4. Run the program!
